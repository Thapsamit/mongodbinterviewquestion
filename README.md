## Q - 1 Mongo db
- MongoDB is a cross-platform document-based database. Categorized as a NoSQL database, MongoDB avoids the conventional table-oriented relational database structure in support of the JSON-like documents with the dynamic schemas, making the data integration in specific kinds of applications quicker and simpler

## Q - 2 Features:-
Document Oriented and NoSQL database.
Supports Aggregation
Uses BSON format
Sharding (Helps in Horizontal Scalability)
Supports Ad Hoc Queries
Schema Less
Capped Collection
Indexing (Any field in MongoDB can be indexed)
MongoDB Replica Set (Provides high availability)
Supports Multiple Storage Engines

## SQL vs NOSQL

## Vertical vs Horizantal scaling

- SQL are vertical scalable This means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD
- NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database

## JSON VS BSON
- BSON is a binary encoded Javascript Object Notation (JSON)â€”a textual object notation widely used to transmit and store data across web based applications.
- BSON encodes type and length information, too, making it easier for machines to parse.
- BSON stands for Binary Javascript Object Notation. It is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON documents. BSON has been extended to add some optional non-JSON-native data types, like dates and binary data.

## Advantages of BSON:-
- Lightweight and Traversable
BSON is lightweight: This makes it possible for a large amount of data to be stored in BSON file format. Additionally, BSON files are easily stored and sent through the network, making them perfect for storing and sending data.

- efficient
- additonal data types
